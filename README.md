This program is used to automate the processing of team ranking information.

The team I will be leading ("flight") is tasked with ranking everyone in the flight, including themselves, each week. In order to share feedback with each member effectively,
I wanted to be able to show them their ranking according to the other flight members. 

The program processes all .xlsx files in a folder and creates corresponding output spreadsheet with a worksheet for each member of the flight. Their sheet shows them their 
average rank, how they ranked their peers and themself, and a histogram of how their peers ranked them. 

I want to further the automation by tracking the previous weeks so that by the end of the semester, each flight memeber can see a graph of how their ranking progressed throughout
the semester.

More instructions to come :)
