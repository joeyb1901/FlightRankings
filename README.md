This program is used to automate the processing of team ranking information in an environment where the team members (A.K.A "flight members") are tasked with ranking
their flight mates, including themself.

When run, the program processes the rankings found in the directoryIn folder (all .xlsx files) and creates a new folder called ProcessedData with a .xlsx for each week
of rankings as well as a summary that tracks each flight member's progression over the weeks of ranking.

The next step is to make the program more fool proof by detecting an error in the ranking inputs such as repeated names or missing names. I would also like it to account
for the possibility of flight members dropping out midsemester, which will be reflected in the following weekly rankings. I would also like it to be more flexible with contingencies such as members not having to rank themself.

More to come :)
